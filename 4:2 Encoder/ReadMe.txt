4 to 2 Encoder has four inputs Y3, Y2, Y1 & Y0 and two outputs A1 & A0. 

At any time, only one of these 4 inputs can be ‘1’ in order to get the respective binary code at the output. The Truth table of 4 to 2 encoder is shown below.

Y3	Y2	Y1	Y0	A1	A0
1	0	0	0	0	0
0	1	0	0	0	1
0	0	1	0	1	0
0	0	0	1	1	1

A1=Y1+Y0
A0=Y0+Y2
