The 4:1 multiplexer is one which has 4 data input lines, 2 select lines, and 1 output line. The block diagram of a 4:1 mux is shown in Figure 3.

Here, I0, I1, I2, and I3 are the four data input lines, S0 and S1 are the two select lines, and Y is the output line. Thus, the logic level of the digital signal applied to S0 and S1 select lines will determine which input will pass to the output line.

The operation of the 4:1 multiplexer can be understood with the help of its truth table given below.

Select Lines	Output
S1	S0	Y
0	0	I0
0	1	I1
1	0	I2
1	1	I3
