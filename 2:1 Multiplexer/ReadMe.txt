A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that has many data inputs and a single output, depending on control or select inputs. For N input lines, log2(N) selection lines are required, or equivalently, for 2^n input lines, n selection lines are needed. Multiplexers are also known as “N-to-1 selectors,” parallel-to-serial converters, many-to-one circuits, and universal logic circuits. They are mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over a network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth.

In the 2:1 multiplexer, the logic level of the digital signal applied to the select line S determines which data input will pass through the output line. The operation of the 2:1 multiplexer can be understood from the following truth table.

S    Y

0    I0
1    I1
