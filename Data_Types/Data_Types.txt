Data Types in verilog

1. wire
2. reg

I. Here, wire is default data type for input and output declaration.
for example, input a,b,cin; ----> this means that a,b,cin are wire by default.

also, wire is usually mentioned when in case of structural program

II. reg is used only in case of output. 

output reg s,c;  ----> here, s,c will hold a value that keeps on changing within the program (usually when it is within the always block).
