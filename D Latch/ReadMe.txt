There is one drawback of SR Latch. That is the next state value canâ€™t be predicted when both the inputs S & R are one. So, we can overcome this difficulty by D Latch. It is also called as Data Latch. 

D Latch Hold the information that is available on data input, D. That means the output of D Latch is sensitive to the changes in the input, D as long as the enable is High.
