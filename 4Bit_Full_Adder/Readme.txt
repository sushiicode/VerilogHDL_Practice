Full Adder is the adder that adds three inputs and produces two outputs. The first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN. The output carry is designated as C-OUT and the normal output is designated as S which is SUM. The C-OUT is also known as the majority 1â€™s detector, whose output goes high when more than one input is high. A full adder logic is designed in such a manner that can take eight inputs together to create a byte-wide adder and cascade the carry bit from one adder to another. we use a full adder because when a carry-in bit is available, another 1-bit adder must be used since a 1-bit half-adder does not take a carry-in bit. A 1-bit full adder adds three operands and generates 2-bit results.
